					<h2> <span class="underline"> Feedback <span> </h2>
							<p class="rose"> As a beginner I have given myself self feedback. Due to my level of enthusiasm for developing a website, I was tending to jump right in to coding without an overall plan. This would not be helpful for time-management because I was spending too much time adding/subtracting ideas from my website. I noticed this and implemented a plan to make a sketch of each and every website I would make from then on. </p>
